# awesome-config
This is the [awesome WM](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) config I have fined-tuned for my daily use at work.
I am currently running it on awesome v3.4.15 on Ubuntu 14.04.

There is no guarantee or warranty at all. Some functionality may not work for you because I am using software
from various desktop environments and you may not have them installed.

Features
 - The 10th tag, binded to `Mod4+0`
 - Renaming the tag by `Mod4+Shift+=`. Tag names are saved so they survive reboots.
 - My personalized floating rules -- all windows are started floating, except for xfce4-terminal and google-chrome.
 - Application shortcuts and changes to default key bindings. See the [cheatsheet](/cheatsheet.txt).
 - My personalized minimalist awesome menu.
 - Customized light-colored theme.
 - Doesn't use any awesome extensions.
 - Support multiple profiles that let you have small tweaks on your differnt
   machines. Use `switch_profile.sh {work|home}` to swich between profiles.
