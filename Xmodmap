! Remap Alt_R as Control_R

! Valid modifier symbols are:
! "shift", "lock" (aka Caps lock), "control",
! "mod1" (aka Alt), "mod2" (aka Num lock), "mod4" (aka Super)
! These are the first column of the output of "xmodmap -pm"

! Keycodes are mapped to key symbols, which are "Shift_L", "Control_R", "Alt_L" etc.
! These are found on the right column of "xmodmap -pm"

! The mapping works as: keycode (e.g. 105) -> key symbol (e.g., Alt_L) -> modifier (e.g., mod1)
! "keycode 105 = Alt_R" maps keycode to key symbol, if necessary

! First, we stop the right Alt from being the "mod1" modifier
remove Mod1 = Alt_R
! Then, make the right Alt a "control" modifier
add Control = Alt_R
