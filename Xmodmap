! Remap Alt_R as Control_R

! Valid modifier symbols are:
! "shift", "lock" (aka Caps lock), "control",
! "mod1" (aka Alt), "mod2" (aka Num lock), "mod4" (aka Super)
! These are the first column of the output of "xmodmap -pm"

! Keycodes are mapped to key symbols, which are "Shift_L", "Control_R", "Alt_L" etc.
! These are found on the right column of "xmodmap -pm"

! The mapping works as: keycode (e.g. 105) -> key symbol (e.g., Alt_L) -> modifier (e.g., mod1)
! "keycode 105 = Alt_R" maps keycode to key symbol, if necessary

keycode 37 = Control_L
keycode 64 = Alt_L
keycode 133 = Super_L
keycode 108 = Alt_R
keycode 134 = Super_R
keycode 135 = Menu
keycode 105 = Control_R

clear Mod1
clear Control

add Mod1 = Alt_L
add Control = Control_L Control_R Alt_R
